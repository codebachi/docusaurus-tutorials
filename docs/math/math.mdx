```gdscript
func _input(event):
   # Mouse in viewport coordinates.
   if event is InputEventMouseButton:
       print("Mouse Click/Unclick at: ", event.position)
   elif event is InputEventMouseMotion:
       print("Mouse Motion at: ", event.position)

   # Print the size of the viewport.
   print("Viewport Resolution is: ", get_viewport_rect().size)
```

$$
d=b-a=
\begin{bmatrix}
 b_x - a_x \\ 
 b_y - a_y \\ 
 b_z - a_z
\end{bmatrix}
$$

The distance between a and b is equal to the length of the vector d,  
which we computed in Section 2.8:

$$
distance(a,b)=\left \| d \right \|=\sqrt{{d_x}^{2}+{d_y}^{2}+{d_z}^{2}}
$$

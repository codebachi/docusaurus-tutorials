title: Dot Product
---

The name **"dot product"** comes from the **dot** symbol used in the notation:

$$
a \cdot b 
$$

Just like scalar-times-vector multiplication, the vector dot product
is performed before addition and subtraction, unless parentheses are used
to override this default order of operations.

Note that although we usually omit the multiplication symbol when multiplying two scalars or a scalar
and a vector, we must not omit the dot symbol when performing a vector
dot product. If you ever see two vectors placed side-by-side with no symbol
in between, interpret this according to the rules of matrix multiplication,
which we discuss in Chapter 4.7
The dot product of two vectors is the sum of the products of corresponding components, resulting in a scalar:

$$
\begin{bmatrix}
 a_1\\  
 a_2\\
 \vdots\\
 a_{n-1}\\
 a_n
\end{bmatrix} \cdot
\begin{bmatrix}
 b_1\\  
 b_2\\
 \vdots\\
 b_{n-1}\\
 b_n
\end{bmatrix} = 
a_1b_1 + a_2b_2 + \cdots + a_{n-1}b_{n-1} + a_nb_n
$$

This can be expressed succinctly by using the summation notation

$$
a \cdot b = \sum_{i=1}^{n} a_ib_i
$$

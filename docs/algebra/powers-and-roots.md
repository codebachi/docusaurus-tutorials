title: Powers and Roots
---

Now it’s time to review and expand your knowledge of powers and roots. When you take a number to an integer power, it's like repeated multiplication. When you take a number to an integer root, it's like repeated division. But powers and roots go deeper than that! With
a few exceptions, you can raise anything to a rational-number power and get a meaningful
result.

## Integer Powers
The simplest powers, also called exponential operations, involve multiplying a number or quantity by itself a certain number of times. The power is written as a superscript after the quantity to be "operated on." This operation is sometimes called ***raising to a power***.

### Positive integer powers
If a is any number and p is a positive integer, the expression a p means a to the pth power,
which is a multiplied by itself p times. More generally, a doesn’t have to be a number. It can
be a variable or a complicated expression containing numbers and variables. Here are some
examples of quantities raised to positive integer powers:

$$
4^{2}\\
x^{4}\\
(k + 4)^{7}\\
(abc)^{4}\\
(m /n)^{12} \qquad \textrm{where} \quad \textrm{n} \neq 0 \\
(x^{2} - 2x + 1)^{5} \\ 
$$

Note that in the last expression, the quantity raised to the 5th power actually contains a variable raised to a different power.

### The 0th power
By convention, anything raised to the $0$th power is equal to $1$. Anything except $0$ itself, that is!
The quantity $0^{0}$ is not defined. You'll see why any nonzero quantity raised to the $0$th power is
equal to $1$ later in this chapter. You'll also see why $0^{0}$ is not defined. Here are some expressions
that are all equal to $1$:


In every expression except the topmost one, there are constraints on the variables in the quantities being raised to the 0th power. These keep the values of the quantities from being equal
to 0. If you’re not sure about the reason for the constraint on x in the last expression, hold on
a minute and you’ll see.
Whenever you find any expression containing variables, and that expression is to be raised
to the 0th power, be sure you never let that expression attain a value of 0. This is especially
important if such an oversight is a step in solving a problem! You would be throwing an undefined quantity into a sensitive process. You’ve heard what computer programmers say about
putting nonsense into a machine! The same thing happens in mathematics.

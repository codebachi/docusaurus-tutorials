Algebra is a science of numbers. To work with numbers, you need symbols to represent them.
The way these symbols relate to actual quantities is called a ***numeration system***. In this chapter, you’ll learn about numeration systems for whole-unit quantities such as 4, 8, 1,509, or
1,580,675. Fractions, negative numbers, and more exotic numbers will come up later.

## Fingers and Sticks
Throughout history, most cultures developed numeration systems based on the number of fingers and thumbs on human hands. The word ***digit*** derives from the Latin word for "finger." This is no accident. Fingers are convenient for counting, at least when the numbers are small!

### Number or numeral?
The words number and numeral are often used as if they mean the same thing. But they're different. A number is an abstraction. You can't see or feel a number. A numeral is a tangible[^1] object, or a group of objects, that represents a number. Suppose you buy a loaf of bread cut into eighteen slices. You can consider the whole sliced-up loaf as a numeral that represents the number eighteen, and each slice as a digit in that numeral. You can't eat the number eighteen, but you can eat the bread.
In this chapter, when we write about numbers as quantities, let's write them out fully in words, like eighteen or forty-five or three hundred twenty-one. When we want to write down a numeral, it's all right to put down $18$ or $45$ or $321$, but we have to be careful about this sort of thing. When you see a large quantity written out in full here, keep this in mind: It means we're dealing with a number, not a numeral.

### :raised_hand_with_fingers_splayed: Figuring with fingers
Imagine it's the afternoon of the twenty-fourth day of July. You have a doctor's appointment for the afternoon of the sixth of August. How many days away is your appointment?

![Figure 1-1 How many days pass from the afternoon of July 24 until the afternoon of August 6? You can make marks on a piece of paper and then count them to figure out the answer.](https://i.imgur.com/CVLg0yb.png)

A calculator won't work very well to solve this problem. Try it and see! You can't get the right answer by any straightforward arithmetic operation on twenty-four and six. If you attack this problem as I would, you'll count out loud starting with tomorrow, July twenty-fifth (under your breath): 

"twenty-five
twenty-six,
twenty-seven,
twenty-eight,
twenty-nine,
thirty,
thirty-one,
one,
two,
three,
four,
five,
six!” 

While jabbering away, I would use my fingers to
count along or make “hash marks” on a piece of paper (Fig. 1-1). You might use a calendar and point to the days one at a time as you count them out. However you do it, you’ll come up with thirteen days if you get it right.

But be careful! This sort of problem is easy to mess up. Don't be embarrassed if you find yourself figuring out simple problems like this using your fingers or other convenient objects. You're making sure that you get the right answer by using numerals to represent the numbers. Numerals are tailor-made for solving number problems because they make abstract things easy to envision.

### Toothpicks on the table
Everyone has used "hash marks" to tally up small numbers. You can represent one item by a single mark and five items by four marks with a long slash. You might use objects such as toothpicks to create numerals in a system that expands on this idea, as shown in Fig. 1-2.

![Figure 1-2 Toothpick-numeral equivalents of some numbers. In this system, most numbers can be represented by more than one numeral. But there is always a "best numeral" that uses the smallest possible number of toothpicks.](https://i.imgur.com/rIgXWLw.png)

You can represent ten by making a capital letter $T$ with two toothpicks. You can represent fifty by using three toothpicks to make a capital letter $F$. You can represent a hundred by making a capital letter H with three toothpicks. This lets you express rather large numbers such as seventy-four or two hundred fifty-three without having to buy several boxes of toothpicks and spend a lot of time laying them down.
In this system, any particular arrangement of sticks is a numeral. You can keep going this way, running an F and H together to create a symbol that represents five hundred. You can run a $T$ and an $H$ together to make a symbol that represents a thousand. How about ten
thousand? You could stick another T onto the left-hand end of the symbol for a thousand, or
you could run two letters H together to indicate that it’s a hundred hundred! Use your imagination. That’s what mathematicians did when they invented numeration systems in centuries
long past.

### Are you confused?
If the toothpick numeral system puzzles you, don’t feel bad. It’s awkward. It’s impractical for expressing
gigantic numbers. People aren’t used to counting in blocks of five or fifty or five hundred. It’s easier to go
straight from blocks of one to blocks of ten, and then from ten to a hundred, then to a thousand, then to
ten thousand, and so on. But using blocks of five, fifty, five hundred and so on, in addition to the traditional multiples of ten, conserves toothpicks.
Here’s a challenge!
Using toothpick numerals represent the number seven hundred seventy-seven in two different ways. Make
sure one of your arrangements is the most “elegant” possible way to represent seven hundred seventyseven, meaning that it uses the smallest possible number of toothpicks.
Solution
Figure 1-3 shows two ways you can represent this number. In order to represent five hundred, you build
the F and the H together so they’re a single connected pattern of sticks. The arrangement on top is the
most “elegant” possible numeral.
You can represent seven hundred seventy-seven in more ways than just the two shown here. You can
make numerals that are far more “inelegant” than the bottom arrangement. The worst possible approach
is to lay down seven hundred seventy-seven toothpicks side-by-side.

## Roman Numerals
The toothpick numeration system just described bears a resemblance to another system that
was actually used in much of the world until a few centuries ago: the Roman numeration
system, more often called Roman numerals.
Basic symbols
In Roman numerals, a quantity of one is represented by a capital letter I. A quantity of five
is represented by a capital V. A quantity of ten is denoted as a capital X, fifty is a capital L, a
hundred is a capital C, five hundred is a capital D, and a thousand is usually represented by a
capital M. (Sometimes K is used instead.)
So far, this looks like a refinement of the toothpick numeration scheme. But there are
some subtle differences. You don’t always write the symbols in straightforward order from left
to right, as you lay down the sticks in the toothpick system. There are exceptions, intended
to save symbols.
Arranging the symbols
The people who designed the Roman system did not like to put down more than three identical symbols in a row. Instead of putting four identical symbols one after another, the writer
would jump up to the next higher symbol and then put the next lower one to its left, indicating that the smaller quantity should be taken away from the larger.
For example, instead of IIII (four ones) to represent four, you would write IV (five with
one taken away). Instead of XXXX (four tens) to represent forty, you’d write XL (fifty with
ten taken away). Instead of MDXXXX to represent one thousand nine hundred, you’d write
MCM (a thousand and then another thousand with a hundred taken away).
What about zero?
By now you must be thinking, “No wonder people got away from Roman numerals, let alone
hash marks. They’re confusing!” But that’s not the only trouble with the Roman numeral
system or the toothpick numeral system we made up earlier. There’s a more serious issue.
Neither of these schemes give you any way to express the quantity zero. This might not seem
important at first thought. Why make a big fuss over a symbol that represents nothing?
Sometimes the best way to see why something is important is to try to get along without it. When you start adding and subtracting, and especially when you start multiplying and dividing, it’s almost impossible to get along without zero. In a computer, the numeral 0 is
one of only two possible digits (the other being 1) for building large numerals. In accounting,
the presence or absence of a single 0 on a piece of paper can represent the difference between
the price of a car and the price of a house.

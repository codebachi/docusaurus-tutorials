I will go this far, however: Understanding how to do long division with some
not-too-horrible numbers is a good idea. In this section, I give you a good
start with long division, telling you how to do a division problem that has a
one-digit divisor.
Recall that the divisor in a division problem is the number that you’re dividing by. When you’re doing long division, the size of the divisor is your main
concern: Small divisors are easy to work with, and large ones are a royal pain.
Suppose you want to find 860 ÷ 5. Start off by writing the problem like this:

$$
\begin{array}{l}
\phantom{5;}{1}\\
5\overline{\smash{)}860}
\end{array}
$$

Unlike the other Big Four operations, long division moves from left to right. In this case, you start with the number in the hundreds column (8). To begin, ask how many times 5 goes into 8 — that is, what’s 8 ÷ 5? The answer is 1 (with a little bit left over), so write 1 directly above the 8. Now multiply 1 × 5 to get 5, place the answer directly below the 8, and draw a line beneath it:

$$
\begin{array}{l}
\phantom{5;}{1}\\
5\overline{\smash{)}860}\\
\phantom{5;}\underline{5}
\end{array}
$$

$$
(\begin{array}{l}
\phantom{5;}{1}\\
5\overline{\smash{)}860}\\
\phantom{x-3}\underline{4x^3-12x^2}\\
\phantom{{x-3}4x^3-12x^2+}2x-6\
\phantom{{x-3}4x^3-12x^2+}\underline{2x-6}\\
\end{array})
$$

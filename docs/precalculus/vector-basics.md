We can define the length of a line segment that connects two points, but the direction is
ambiguous. If we want to take the direction into account, we must make a line segment into
a vector. Mathematicians write vector names as bold letters of the alphabet. Alternatively, a
vector name can be denoted as a letter with a line or arrow over it.

## The "Cartesian Way"

In diagrams and graphs, a vector is drawn as a directed line segment whose direction is portrayed by putting an arrow at one end. When working in two-space, we can describe vectors
in Cartesian coordinates or in polar coordinates. Let’s look at the “Cartesian way” first.

### Endpoints, locations, and notations

Figure 4-1 shows four vectors drawn on a Cartesian coordinate grid. Each vector has a beginning (the originating point) and an end space (the terminating point).

In this situation, any of
the four vectors can be defined according to two independent quantities:
• The length (magnitude)
• The way it points (direction)
It doesn’t matter where the originating or terminating points actually are. The important
thing is how the two points are located with respect to each other. Once a vector has been
defined as having a specific magnitude and direction, we can “slide it around” all over the
coordinate plane without changing its essential nature.
We can always think of the originating point for a vector as being located at the
coordinate origin (0,0). When we place a vector so that its originating point is at (0,0),
we say that the vector is in standard form. The standard form is convenient in Cartesian coordinates, because it allows us to uniquely define any vector as an ordered pair corresponding to

* The x coordinate of its terminating point (x component)
* The y coordinate of its terminating point (y component)

Figure 4-2 shows the same four vectors as Fig. 4-1 does, but all of the originating points have
been moved to the coordinate origin. The magnitudes and directions of the corresponding
vectors in Figs. 4-1 and 4-2 are identical. That’s how we can tell that the vectors a, b, c, and d
in Fig. 4-2 represent the same mathematical objects as the vectors a, b, c, and d in Fig. 4-1.

### Cartesian magnitude
Imagine an arbitrary vector a in the Cartesian xy plane, extending from the origin (0,0) to the
point (xa,ya) as shown in Fig. 4-3. The magnitude of a (which can be denoted as ra, as |a|, or
as a) can be found by applying the formula for the distance of a point from the origin. We
learned that formula in Chap. 1. Here it is, modified for the vector situation:

$$
ra = ({x_{a}}^{2} + {y_{a}}^{2})^{1/2}
$$

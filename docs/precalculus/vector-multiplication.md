## Product of Scalar and Vector
The simplest form of vector multiplication involves changing the magnitude by a real-number
factor called a scalar. A scalar is a one-dimensional quantity that can be positive, negative, or
zero. If the scalar is positive, the vector direction stays the same. If the scalar is negative, the
vector direction reverses. If the scalar is zero, the vector disappears.


### Cartesian vector times positive scalar
Imagine a standard-form vector a in the Cartesian xy plane, defined by an ordered pair whose
coordinates are $x_a$ and $y_a$, so that

$$
a = (x_a, y_a)
$$

Suppose that we multiply a positive scalar $k_+$ by each of the vector coordinates individually,
getting two new coordinates. Mathematically, we write this as

$$
k_{+}a = (k_{+}x_a, k_{+}y_a)
$$

This vector is called the left-hand Cartesian product of k+ and a. If we multiply both original
coordinates on the right by k+ instead, we get
ak+ = (xak+,yak+)

### Dot Product of Two Vectors

Mathematicians define two ways in which a vector can be multiplied by another vector. The simpler operation is called the dot product and is symbolized by a large dot (•). Sometimes it’s called
the scalar product because the end result is a scalar. Some texts refer to it as the inner product.

#### Cartesian dot product
Suppose we’re given two standard-form vectors a and b in Cartesian coordinates, defined by
the ordered pairs

#### Polar dot product

### Cross Product of Two Vectors

The more complicated (and interesting) way to multiply two vectors by each other gives us
a third vector that “jumps” out of the coordinate plane. This operation is known as the cross
product. Some mathematicians call it the vector product. The cross product of two vectors $a$
and $b$ is written as $a × b$.

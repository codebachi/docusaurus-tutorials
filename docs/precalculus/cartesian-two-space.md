If you’ve taken a course in algebra or geometry, you’ve learned about the graphing system
called Cartesian (pronounced "car-TEE-zhun") two-space, also known as Cartesian coordinates
or the Cartesian plane. Let's review the basics of this system, and then we'll learn how to calculate distances in it.

## How It's Assembled
We can put together a Cartesian plane by positioning two identical real-number lines so they
intersect at their **zero points** and are **perpendicular** to each other. The point of intersection is called the **origin**. Each number line forms an axis that can represent the values of a mathematical variable.

### The variables
Figure 1-1 shows a simple set of Cartesian coordinates. One variable is portrayed along a **horizontal line**, and the other variable is portrayed along a **vertical line**. The number-line scales are graduated in increments of the same size.

Figure 1-2 shows how several ordered pairs of the form $(x, y)$ are plotted as points on the Cartesian plane. Here, $x$ represents the **independent variable** (the "input"), and $y$ represents the **dependent variable** (the "output"). Technically, when we work in the Cartesian plane, the numbers in an ordered pair represent the coordinates of a point on the plane. People sometimes say or write things as if the ordered pair actually is the **point**, but technically the 순서쌍<sup>ordered pair</sup> is the 점<sup>point</sup>의 이름.

### Interval notation
In **pre-calculus** and **calculus**, we'll often want to express a continuous span of values that a variable can attain. Such a span is called an **interval**. An interval always has a certain minimum value and a certain maximum value. These are the extremes of the interval. Let's be sure that you're familiar with standard interval terminology and notation, so it won't confuse you later on. Consider these four situations:

$$
0 < x < 2 \\
-1 \leq y < 0 \\
4 < z \leq 8 \\
-\pi \leq \theta \leq \pi \\
$$

These expressions have the following meanings, in order:

* The value of $x$ is larger than $0$, but smaller than $2$.
* The value of $y$ is larger than or equal to $−1$, but smaller than $0$.
* The value of $z$ is larger than $4$, but smaller than or equal to $8$.
* The value of $\theta$ is larger than or equal to $−\pi$, but smaller than or equal to $\pi$.

The first case is an example of an open interval, which we can write as

$$
x \in (0, 2)
$$

which translates to “x is an element of the open interval (0,2).” Don’t mistake this open
interval for an ordered pair! The notations look the same, but the meanings are completely
different. The second and third cases are examples of half-open intervals. We denote this type
of interval with a square bracket on the side of the included value and a rounded parenthesis
on the side of the non-included value. We can write

$$
y \in [−1, 0)
$$

which means “y is an element of the half-open interval [−1,0),” and

$$
z \in (4, 8]
$$

which means “z is an element of the half-open interval (4,8].” The fourth case is an example of
a closed interval. We use square brackets on both sides to show that both extremes are included.
We can write this as

$$
\theta \in [−\pi, \pi]
$$

which translates to “q is an element of the closed interval $[−\pi, \pi]$."

### Relations and functions
Do you remember the definitions of the terms relation and function from your algebra courses?
(If you read Algebra Know-It-All, you should!) These terms are used often in pre-calculus, so
it’s important that you be familiar with them. A relation is an operation that transforms, or
maps, values of a variable into values of another variable. A function is a relation in which there
is never more than one value of the dependent variable for any value of the independent variable. In other words, there can’t be more than one output for any input. (If a particular input produces no output, that’s okay.) The Cartesian plane gives us an excellent way to illustrate
relations and functions.

### The axes
In a Cartesian plane, both axes are linear, and both axes are graduated in increments of the
same size. On either axis, the change in value is always directly proportional to the physical
displacement. For example, if we travel 5 millimeters along an axis and the value changes by
1 unit, then that fact is true everywhere along that axis, and it’s also true everywhere along the
other axis.

### The quadrants
Any pair of intersecting lines divides a plane into four parts. In the Cartesian system, these
parts are called quadrants, as shown in Fig. 1-3:

* In the first quadrant, both variables are positive.
* In the second quadrant, the independent variable is negative and the dependent variable is positive.
* In the third quadrant, both variables are negative.
* In the fourth quadrant, the independent variable is positive and the dependent variable is negative.

![Figure 1-3 The Cartesian plane is divided into quadrants. The first, second, third, and fourth quadrants are sometimes labeled I, II, III, and IV, respectively.](https://i.imgur.com/ipfIYAu.png)

The quadrants are sometimes labeled with Roman numerals, so that

* Quadrant I is at the upper right
* Quadrant II is at the upper left
* Quadrant III is at the lower left
* Quadrant IV is at the lower right

If a point lies on one of the axes or at the origin, then it is not in any quadrant.

## Disclaimer

It has been a year since we made the first **alpha release** of Docusaurus 2 and things have been pretty stable since then. Many of Facebook's new open source websites are using Docusaurus 2 now. At this point, we highly encourage you to use Docusaurus 2 over Docusaurus 1 for your new websites. For feedback and questions, chat with us on [**Discord**](https://discordapp.com/invite/docusaurus) :wink:.

**You should use this if:**

- :white_check_mark: You want to contribute to Docusaurus 2
- :white_check_mark: You want to build a modern website with client-side routing and prerendering
- :white_check_mark: You want to provide feedback to make sure Docusaurus 2 suits your needs
- :white_check_mark: You are curious about what comes next as a Docusaurus user

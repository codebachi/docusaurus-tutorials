Documentation is one of your product's interfaces with your users. A well-written and well-organized set of docs helps your users understand your product quickly. Our aligned goal here is to help your users find and understand the information they need, as quickly as possible.

Docusaurus 2 uses modern tooling to help you compose your interactive documentations with ease. You may embed React components, or build live coding blocks where your users may play with the code on the spot. Start sharing your eureka moments with the code your audience cannot walk away from. It is perhaps the most effective way of attracting potential users.

In this section, we'd like to introduce you to the tools we've picked that we believe will help you build powerful documentation. Let us walk you through with an example.

Markdown is a syntax that enables you to write formatted content in a readable syntax. The [표준 마크다운 문법](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax) is supported and we use [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/) as the 파싱 엔진, which can do much more than just parsing Markdown. More on that later.

Create a markdown file, `greeting.md`, and place it under the `docs` directory.

```bash
website # root directory of your site
├── docs
│   └── greeting.md
├── src
│   └── pages
├── docusaurus.config.js
├── ...
```

<!-- TODO: talk about where to put the docs, resolving docs outside of website directory, etc. -->

At the top of the file, specify `id` and `title` in the front matter, so that Docusaurus will pick them up correctly when generating your site.

```yml
---
id: greeting
title: Hello
---

## Hello from Docusaurus

Are you ready to create the documentation site for your open source project?

### Headers

will show up on the table of contents on the upper right

So that your users will know what this page is all about without scrolling down or even without reading too much.

### Only h2 and h3 will be in the toc

The headers are well-spaced so that the hierarchy is clear.

- lists will help you
- present the key points
- that you want your users to remember
  - and you may nest them
    - multiple times
```
This will render in the browser as follows:

import BrowserWindow from '@site/src/components/BrowserWindow';

<BrowserWindow url="http://localhost:3000">

## Markdown headers

Documents use the following markdown header fields that are enclosed by a line `---` on either side:

- `id`: A unique document id. If this field is not present, the document's `id` will default to its file name (without the extension).
- `title`: The title of your document. If this field is not present, the document's `title` will default to its `id`.
- `hide_title`: Whether to hide the title at the top of the doc. By default it is `false`.
- `hide_table_of_contents`: Whether to hide the table of contents to the right. By default it is `false`.
- `sidebar_label`: The text shown in the document sidebar and in the next/previous button for this document. If this field is not present, the document's `sidebar_label` will default to its `title`.
- `custom_edit_url`: The URL for editing this document. If this field is not present, the document's edit URL will fall back to `editUrl` from options fields passed to `docusaurus-plugin-content-docs`.
- `keywords`: Keywords meta tag for the document page, for search engines.
- `description`: The description of your document, which will become the `<meta name="description" content="..."/>` and `<meta property="og:description" content="..."/>` in `<head>`, used by search engines. If this field is not present, it will default to the first line of the contents.
- `image`: Cover or thumbnail image that will be used when displaying the link to your post.

Example:

```yml
---
id: doc-markdown
title: Markdown Features
hide_title: false
hide_table_of_contents: false
sidebar_label: Markdown :)
custom_edit_url: https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/edit/master/docs/api-doc-markdown.md
description: How do I find you when I cannot solve this problem
keywords:
  - docs
  - docusaurus

## Referencing other documents

If you want to reference another document file, you could use the name of the document you want to reference. Docusaurus will convert the file path to be the final website path (and remove the `.md`).

For example, if you are in `doc2.md` and you want to reference `doc1.md` and `folder/doc3.md`:

```md
I am referencing a [document](doc1.md). Reference to another [document in a folder](folder/doc3.md).

[Relative document](../doc2.md) referencing works as well.
```

One benefit of this approach is that the links to external files will still work if you are viewing the file on GitHub.

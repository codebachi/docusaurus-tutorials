Documentation is one of your product's interfaces with your users. A well-written and well-organized set of docs helps your users understand your product quickly. Our aligned goal here is to help your users find and understand the information they need, as quickly as possible.

Docusaurus 2 uses modern tooling to help you compose your interactive documentations with ease. You may embed React components, or build live coding blocks where your users may play with the code on the spot. Start sharing your eureka moments with the code your audience cannot walk away from. It is perhaps the most effective way of attracting potential users.

In this section, we'd like to introduce you to the tools we've picked that we believe will help you build powerful documentation. Let us walk you through with an example.

All the following content assumes you are using `@docusaurus/preset-classic` or `@docusaurus/plugin-content-docs`.

Markdown is a syntax that enables you to write formatted content in a readable syntax. The [표준 마크다운 문법](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax) is supported and we use [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/) as the 파싱 엔진, which can do much more than just parsing Markdown. More on that later.

Create a markdown file, `greeting.md`, and place it under the `docs` directory.

```bash
website # root directory of your site
├── docs
│   └── greeting.md
├── src
│   └── pages
├── docusaurus.config.js
├── ...
```

<!-- TODO: talk about where to put the docs, resolving docs outside of website directory, etc. -->

At the top of the file, specify `id` and `title` in the front matter, so that Docusaurus will pick them up correctly when generating your site.

```yml
---
id: greeting
title: Hello
---

## Hello from Docusaurus

Are you ready to create the documentation site for your open source project?

### Headers

will show up on the table of contents on the upper right

So that your users will know what this page is all about without scrolling down or even without reading too much.

### Only h2 and h3 will be in the toc

The headers are well-spaced so that the hierarchy is clear.

- lists will help you
- present the key points
- that you want your users to remember
  - and you may nest them
    - multiple times
```
This will render in the browser as follows:

import BrowserWindow from '@site/src/components/BrowserWindow';

<BrowserWindow url="http://localhost:3000">

<h2>Hello from Docusaurus</h2>

Are you ready to create the documentation site for your open source project?

<h3>Headers</h3>

will show up on the table of contents on the upper right

So that your users will know what this page is all about without scrolling down or even without reading too much.

<h3>Only h2 and h3 will be in the toc</h3>

The headers are well-spaced so that the hierarchy is clear.

- lists will help you
- present the key points
- that you want your users to remember
  - and you may nest them
    - multiple times

</BrowserWindow>

## Markdown headers

Documents use the following markdown header fields that are enclosed by a line `---` on either side:

- `id`: A unique document id. If this field is not present, the document's `id` will default to its file name (without the extension).
- `title`: The title of your document. If this field is not present, the document's `title` will default to its `id`.
- `hide_title`: Whether to hide the title at the top of the doc. By default it is `false`.
- `hide_table_of_contents`: Whether to hide the table of contents to the right. By default it is `false`.
- `sidebar_label`: The text shown in the document sidebar and in the next/previous button for this document. If this field is not present, the document's `sidebar_label` will default to its `title`.
- `custom_edit_url`: The URL for editing this document. If this field is not present, the document's edit URL will fall back to `editUrl` from options fields passed to `docusaurus-plugin-content-docs`.
- `keywords`: Keywords meta tag for the document page, for search engines.
- `description`: The description of your document, which will become the `<meta name="description" content="..."/>` and `<meta property="og:description" content="..."/>` in `<head>`, used by search engines. If this field is not present, it will default to the first line of the contents.
- `image`: Cover or thumbnail image that will be used when displaying the link to your post.

Example:

```yml
---
id: doc-markdown
title: Markdown Features
hide_title: false
hide_table_of_contents: false
sidebar_label: Markdown :)
custom_edit_url: https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/edit/master/docs/api-doc-markdown.md
description: How do I find you when I cannot solve this problem
keywords:
  - docs
  - docusaurus

```

## Referencing other documents

If you want to reference another document file, you could use the name of the document you want to reference. Docusaurus will convert the file path to be the final website path (and remove the `.md`).

For example, if you are in `doc2.md` and you want to reference `doc1.md` and `folder/doc3.md`:

```md
I am referencing a [document](doc1.md). Reference to another [document in a folder](folder/doc3.md).

[Relative document](../doc2.md) referencing works as well.
```

One benefit of this approach is that the links to external files will still work if you are viewing the file on GitHub.



## Embedding React components with MDX

Docusaurus has built-in support for [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/), which allows you to write JSX within your Markdown files and render them as React components.

**Note 1:** While both `.md` and `.mdx` files are parsed using MDX, some of the syntax are treated slightly differently. For the most accurate parsing and better editor support, we recommend using the `.mdx` extension for files containing MDX syntax. Let's rename the previous file to `greeting.mdx`.

**Note 2:** Since all doc files are parsed using MDX, any HTML is treated as JSX. Therefore, if you need to inline-style a component, follow JSX flavor and provide style objects. This behavior is different from Docusaurus 1.
See also [Migrating from v1 to v2](../guides/migrating).

Try this block here:

```jsx
export const Highlight = ({children, color}) => (
  <span
    style={{
      backgroundColor: color,
      borderRadius: '2px',
      color: '#fff',
      padding: '0.2rem',
    }}>
    {children}
  </span>
);

<Highlight color="#25c2a0">Docusaurus green</Highlight> and <Highlight color="#1877F2">Facebook blue</Highlight> are my favorite colors.

I can write **Markdown** alongside my _JSX_!
```

Notice how it renders both the markup from your React component and the Markdown syntax:

export const Highlight = ({children, color}) => (
  <span
    style={{
      backgroundColor: color,
      borderRadius: '2px',
      color: '#fff',
      padding: '0.2rem',
    }}>
    {children}
  </span>
);

<BrowserWindow minHeight={240} url="http://localhost:3000">

<Highlight color="#25c2a0">Docusaurus green</Highlight>
{` `}and <Highlight color="#1877F2">Facebook blue</Highlight> are my favorite colors.

I can write **Markdown** alongside my _JSX_!

</BrowserWindow>

You can also import your own components defined in other files or third-party components installed via npm! Check out the [MDX docs](https://mdxjs.com/) to see what other fancy stuff you can do with MDX.

### Configuring plugins

You can expand the MDX functionalities, using plugins. An MDX plugin is usually a npm package, so you install them like other npm packages using npm. Docusaurus supports both [Remark](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark) and [Rehype](https://github.com/rehypejs/rehype) plugins that work with MDX.

First, install your [Remark](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark/blob/main/doc/plugins.md#list-of-plugins) and [Rehype](https://github.com/rehypejs/rehype/blob/main/doc/plugins.md#list-of-plugins) plugins.

For example:

```bash npm2yarn
npm install --save remark-images
npm install --save rehype-truncate
```

Next, import the plugins:

```js
const remarkImages = require('remark-images');
const rehypeTruncate = require('rehype-truncate');
```

Finally, add them to the `@docusaurus/preset-classic` options in `docusaurus.config.js`:

```js {10,11} title="docusaurus.config.js"
module.exports = {
  // ...
  presets: [
    [
      '@docusaurus/preset-classic',
      {
        docs: {
          sidebarPath: require.resolve('./sidebars.js'),
          // ...
          remarkPlugins: [remarkImages],
          rehypePlugins: [rehypeTruncate],
        },
      },
    ],
  ],
};
```

### Configuring plugin options

Some plugins can be configured and accept their own options. In that case, use the `[plugin, pluginOptions]` syntax, like so:

```jsx {10-13} title="docusaurus.config.js"
module.exports = {
  // ...
  presets: [
    [
      '@docusaurus/preset-classic',
      {
        docs: {
          sidebarPath: require.resolve('./sidebars.js'),
          // ...
          remarkPlugins: [
            plugin1,
            [plugin2, {option1: {...}}],
          ],
        },
      },
    ],
  ],
};
```

See more information in the [MDX documentation](https://mdxjs.com/advanced/plugins).


## Assets

Sometimes you want to link to static assets directly from Markdown files, and it is convenient to co-locate the asset next to the markdown file using it.

We have setup Webpack loaders to handle most common file types, so that when you import a file, you get its url, and the asset is automatically copied to the output folder.

Let's imagine the following file structure:

```
# Your doc
/website/docs/myFeature.mdx

# Some assets you want to use
/website/docs/assets/docusaurus-asset-example-banner.png
/website/docs/assets/docusaurus-asset-example-pdf.pdf
```

### Images

You can use images in Markdown, or by requiring them and using a JSX image tag:

```mdx
# My Markdown page

<img src={require('./assets/docusaurus-asset-example-banner.png').default} />

or

![](./assets/docusaurus-asset-example-banner.png)
```

The ES imports syntax also works:

```mdx
# My Markdown page

import myImageUrl from './assets/docusaurus-asset-example-banner.png';

<img src={myImageUrl)}/>
```

This results in displaying the image:

![](./assets/docusaurus-asset-example-banner.png)

### Files

In the same way, you can link to existing assets by requiring them and using the returned url in videos, links etc.

```mdx
# My Markdown page

<a
  target="_blank"
  href={require('./assets/docusaurus-asset-example-pdf.pdf').default}>
  Download this PDF
</a>

or

[Download this PDF using Markdown](./assets/docusaurus-asset-example-pdf.pdf)
```

<a
  target="_blank"
  href={require('./assets/docusaurus-asset-example-pdf.pdf').default}>
  Download this PDF
</a>

[Download this PDF using Markdown](./assets/docusaurus-asset-example-pdf.pdf)

### Inline SVGs

Docusaurus supports inlining SVGs out of the box.

```js
import DocusaurusSvg from './docusaurus.svg';

<DocusaurusSvg />;
```

import DocusaurusSvg from '@site/static/img/docusaurus.svg';

<DocusaurusSvg />

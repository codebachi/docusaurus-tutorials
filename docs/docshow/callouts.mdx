## Callouts/admonitions

In addition to the basic Markdown syntax, we use [remark-admonitions](https://github.com/elviswolcott/remark-admonitions) alongside MDX to add support for admonitions. Admonitions are wrapped by a set of 3 colons.

Example:

    :::note
    The content and title *can* include markdown.
    :::

    :::tip You can specify an optional title
    Heads up! Here's a pro-tip.
    :::

    :::info

    :::

    :::caution
    Warning! You better pay attention!

    :::danger

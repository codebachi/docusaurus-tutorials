## Naming Numbers
Our number system is called the Hindu-Arabic system or decimal system. It consists of 10 symbols or digits,

$$
0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, \quad \textrm{그리고} \quad 9,
$$

which are used to make our numbers. Each digit in a number has a place value. The place
value names are shown in Fig. 1-1

In larger numbers, each group of three numbers (called a period) is ***separated by a comma***. The names at the top of the columns in Fig. 1-1 are called ***period names***.
To name a number, start at the left and going to the right, read each group of three numbers separately using the period name at the comma. The word "ones" is not used when naming numbers.

#### EXAMPLE
Name 83,261,403.

#### SOLUTION
Eighty-three million, two hundred sixty-one thousand, four hundred three.

#### EXAMPLE
Name 308,657.

#### SOLUTION
Three hundred eight thousand, six hundred fifty-seven.

#### EXAMPLE
Name 413,000,000,025.

#### SOLUTION
Four hundred thirteen billion, twenty-five

:::note Math Note
Other period names after trillions in increasing order
are quadrillion, quintillion, sextillion, septillion, octillion, nonillion, decillion and undecillion...
:::

#### PRACTICE
Name each number:
1. 632
2. 8,506
3. 413,857
4. 33,605,493,600

#### ANSWERS
1. Six hundred thirty-two
2. Eight thousand, five hundred six
3. Four hundred thirteen thousand, eight hundred fifty-seven
4. Thirty-three billion, six hundred five million, four hundred ninetythree thousand, six hundred

## Rounding Numbers
Many times it is not necessary to use an exact number. In this case, an approximate number can be used. Approximations can be obtained by rounding numbers. All numbers can be rounded to specific place values. To round a number to a specific place value, first locate that place value digit in the number. If the digit to the right of the specific place value digit is 

$$
0, 1, 2, 3, \quad \textrm{또는} \quad 4
$$

the place value digit remains the same. If the digit to the right of the
specific place value digit is 

$$
5, 6, 7, 8, \quad \textrm{또는} \quad 9
$$

add one to the specific place value digit. All digits to the right of the specific place value digit are changed to zeros.

#### EXAMPLE
Round $3,261$ to the nearest hundred.

#### SOLUTION
We are rounding to the hundreds place, which is the digit $2$. Since the digit to the right of the $2$ is $6$, add $1$ to $2$ to get $3$. Change all digits to the right to zeros. Hence $3,261$ rounded to the nearest hundred is $3,300$.

#### EXAMPLE
Round $38,245$ to the nearest thousand.

#### SOLUTION
We are rounding to the thousands place, which is the digit $8$. Since the digit to the right of the $8$ is $2$, the $8$ stays the same. Change all digits to the right of $8$ to zeros. Hence $38,245$ rounded to the nearest thousand is $38,000$.

#### EXAMPLE
Round $398,261$ to the nearest ten thousand.

#### SOLUTION
We are rounding to the ten thousands place, which is the digit $9$. Since the digit to the right of the $9$ is $8$, the $9$ becomes a $10$. Then we write the $0$ and add the $1$ to the next digit. The $3$ then becomes a $4$. Hence the answer is $400,000$.

#### PRACTICE
1. Round $3,725$ to the nearest thousand
2. Round $563,218$ to the nearest ten thousands.
3. Round $80,006$ to the nearest $10$.
4. Round $478,375$ to the nearest hundred thousand.
5. Round $32,864,371$ to the nearest million.

#### ANSWERS
1. $4,000$
2. $560,000$
3. $80,010$
4. $500,000$
5. $33,000,000$

## Addition of Whole Numbers
In mathematics, addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division are called operations. The numbers being added are called **addends**. The total is called the **sum**.

$$
\frac{1}{7}\
$$

3 addend
þ 4 addend
7 sum
To add two or more numbers, first write them in a column, and then add the
digits in the columns from right to left. If the sum of the digits in any column is
10 or more, write the ones digit and carry the tens digit to the next column and
add it to the numbers in that column.

EXAMPLE
Add 24 þ 185 þ 3,625 þ 9.
